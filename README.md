Making programs as I learn rust

- fib: really basic fibonacci generator test program.\
       For fun, the numbers are stored in a long array since fibonacci numbers can exceed a 64 bit integer quite quickly.
       Of course, the better way would be to use a crate that brings in support for big numbers. But even with this
       less than ideal solution, I'm pretty impressed so far with the speed.
